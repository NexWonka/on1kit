		The Pepereum Network is a blockchain-based network built on the Ethereum blockchain that is
		primarily focused on providing a platform for the creation, sharing, and distribution of memes
		in a decentralized manner. The Pepereum Network aims to provide a community-driven ecosystem
		that enables meme creators, curators, and enthusiasts to interact with each other in a secure,
		transparent, and censorship-resistant manner.

	<h1>
		Memes have become an integral part of internet culture, and the Pepereum Network aims to harness
		the power of memes by creating a platform that incentivizes users to create and share memes. The
		platform utilizes a token, named Pepereum (PEP), which is designed to facilitate transactions on
		the network and incentivize users to participate.
