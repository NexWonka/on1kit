		<h1>
			The Pepereum Network uses a modified version of the proof-of-stake consensus mechanism. In
			this consensus mechanism, Pepereum Network holders can stake their tokens to participate in
			the validation of transactions on the network. Validators are selected randomly based on the
			amount of Pepereum Network they have staked, and are rewarded with Pepereum Network for their
			participation.

		<h1>
			The Pepereum Network is governed by its community of users. The platform utilizes a
			decentralized governance model, where users can propose changes and vote on proposals.
			Proposals can include changes to the platform's features, updates to the consensus mechanism,
			or changes to the token economics.
